In the alma mater I got acquainted with the Internet, which determined all my further life. For some time I worked in the field of 3D-modelling and VR, but eventually focused on web design and programming.",
        "Getting to know Bitcoin and blockchain technology at the end of 2009 served as the ground zero for the idea that with time materialised into the technical and conceptual components: WRIO Internet OS and Alternative. Already in 2010 thanks to a team of freelancers that soon became webRunes the technical part started to be put into the code.",
        "At present time I manage projects and develop the webRunes team. Nevertheless I still find time to study new technologies, many of which are afterwards implemented in WRIO Internet OS as it develops."
