We have started in September 2010. Today our goal is to develop a unique platform that will serve as a basis for different projects that help people in various areas of life from the childhood to the old age: education, healthcare, sport, law and etc. We are against growing trends for Internet censorship and information access restriction, so we use only uncopyrighted data.",
        "articleBody": [
        "webRunes is the first contractor for Alternative project. And we are the first ad hoc team of freelancers specializing in various IT fields and other areas of expertise that are developing WRIO Internet OS platform. WRIO Internet OS is a gate to semantic, decentralized and secure Internet. The platform is required for the technical implementation of Alternative — a set of projects aimed at the development of a free self-managed society, an alternative approach to the interaction of people with minimal or even without participation of the government. The technical implementation is presented in the form of interconnected services that help people throughout their lives in different area: education, health, communication, finance and others.",
        "First thoughts about the project emerged in late May 2010, and already on September 20 the first developer started its work. By that time, the initial service concepts were developed, which later became applications of WRIO Internet OS.",
        "Using only own founder’s funds, for over four years, we have worked our way up from a bare idea to the first working version, developing several prototypes and making a number of pivots, to eventually find a solid approach to the technical implementation of WRIO OS and answer to the question of Alternative: «what projects should be implemented and, more importantly, how, in order to make this world a better place, or at least inspire others to do try». The idea is not original, but some extra effort on this way is never superfluous. Moreover, it has been decided, what projects are needed to promote of WRIO Internet OS.",
        "For the future we have more global plans related to the system management by a core based on AI algorithms — IA (Individual Assistant, reverse of AI — artificial intelligence), which will become each user's personal guide to the world of the Internet and will add a variety of extra functions, in particular on the selection of articles, books, music, video and other content. Today, the first version of IA is just a set of scenarios with a given reaction, but in the future, the system will be much more complex and advanced, as you can read in IA hub."

        "In a single sentence our technical mission can be described as the development of technologies aimed at the rise of a free and decentralized Internet based on cryptography and blockchain that will be beyond the control of national governments and corporations.",
        "We develop more than isolated projects with a set of functions. They are conceptually interrelated, which significantly expands the scope of their applicability and enables the synergy – when the aggregated effect substantially surpasses the sum of individual components. The functional is developed in a way to render assistance literally to every user in everyday life. The services will be useful both for private and corporate segments. We started from offering the possibility of creating a private hub and publishing articles from grateful readers with a donate-functionality. As we go forward we’ll extend the functionality to offer content distribution services: audio, video, articles, books, training courses, soft, games, mobile applications and etc. But our primary technological goal is to develop an intelligent system that not only will select interesting materials for users and relevant readers for authors, but also will provide a unique personal secretary service that will act as an assistant and counselor in various everyday personal and professional matters. The system is required to achieve our next longshot goal: to assist users in lifelong learning. In its own turn this is just another step to help users to obtain new knowledge and extend the horizons of their outlook ensuring access to reliable information. That goal is reflected in webRunes logo. We believe that raising the level of education will improve living standards of people and the society in general.",

        "Freedom. Only a free society where everyone can pursue their opportunities without any restrictions can leverage maximum efficiency. Cryptography and anonymity are prerequisites of freedom and are the core of our projects.",
        "A free use of text and code of our projects is the basis of our next principle, which is the openness. Instead of centralized databases we implemented and popularize the technology of blockchain that brings openness to a whole new level: no censorship or information blocking, and is the central core of WRIO Internet OS platform developed by us.",
        "Open Copyright project is a conceptual implementation of the principle and allows anyone to improve, modify or create something new on the basis of existent without any restrictions. So that those who follow could also make one further step on the way of developing software, science, culture and etc. All this is possible without regard to artificial constraints and restrictions of distribution or use of knowledge and information, which are typical of the patents and copyright.",
        "Open Copyright and Education projects further aid another our principle – the spread of knowledge. It is not enough to simply have certain knowledge to ensure efficient and rapid progress of the society, which is in direct dependence on the welfare of each individual. It is necessary to ensure free distribution of information between people, which will raise the general level of education and culture. These, in their turn, are prerequisites for the progress of the humankind. Knowledge must flow.",
        "Cooperation. Openness and free distribution contribute to entering into various types of cooperation based on mutual benefits as opposed to current governmental systems built on the principles of constraint and limitless prohibitions, restrictions and regulations. More information about the principle of cooperation is available in What We Do section.",
        "The ad hoc approach represents a further development of the cooperation concept and centers on the absence of centralization and hierarchy. For each particular task the most qualified candidates are selected, either manually or automatically. The approach guarantees maximum flexibility while ensuring optimum performance costs, time and efficiency. It is a structural basis for Alternative contractors. Additional information is available in the ad hoc teams section.",
        "The aforesaid gives rise to diversity. It is not possible to create something that will satisfy everyone in every aspect. The solution would be either to enforce compulsive evening-out, or to provide opportunities for individual and independent parallel development. We advocate the abundance of choice, since we believe that a dull and grey uniformity has no chance of bringing a better life to people: it is possible only if every one of us is given a freedom of personal development. Identical is unable to be the source of something new. It may seem as a paradox, however only individual differences ensure our overall development as species, which is best confirmed by the evolution.",
        "Transparency. A just society can only be built provided that there are no secrets. It must be understood that among other things personal data shall be unconditionally protected by cryptography (see the first principle, “freedom”). Unfortunately, nowadays the opposite is true: governments and corporations strive for knowing everything about everyone while staying in the shadows themselves. The blockchain technology is capable of finally setting the world back on its feet, and is the implementation not only of the above mentioned principle of openness, but of transparency as well.",
        "The modularity is one of the most important criteria our projects are based on, and it ensures the flexibility of the system enabling a free matching of various modules to obtain the required set of functions. Dedicated projects are also developed within that concept, which makes it possible to easily replace one elements with others to obtain a new result without the risk of destroying the entire structure.",

The win-win strategy, when all participants benefit this way or another, is our standard approach when interacting with the world. We endeavor to adopt and generalize the approach as wide as possible. The strategy is the core of Alternative – a society project based on the concepts of cooperation advantages instead of today's primitive and ineffective approach of society management based on the governmental monopoly on coercion and violence.",
        "The ultimate goal of the projects is to develop principles the society may be built on and continue its existence outside of freedom-stifling framework of hierarchy and bureaucracy established since the time out of mind. The principles that will contribute to the foundation of unconstrained communities living by a freely chosen code. The development is not some sort of ivory-tower theoretical rationale – it is accomplishable to all practical purposes.",
        "The webRunes itself is based on one of the principles propagated by us: contractor of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). The principle is fundamental for the interaction of free Alternative market agents. By this example not only we raise the possibility of such systems existence, but also highlight numerous associated benefits as compared to traditional and obsolete hierarchic companies.",
